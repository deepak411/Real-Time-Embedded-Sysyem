Note : 1. Update the "pinmux.c" file in directory /zephyr-project/boards/x86/galileo.
          Change the first pinmux setting in struture "_galileo_path" as follows:
          To use GPIO3 as output set EXP1(0,1 pin) to (PIN_LOW,PIN_LOW)       // currently it is (PIN_HIGH, PIN_LOW)  
       2. Change the sampling frequency for fatser stablization of kalman filter output. The thread has default period of 500ms, so sampling frequency is 2 Hz.
	  For faster stabilization of Output values of Kalman Filter, the sleep time/period can be changed from the following macros :
		#define SLEEPTIMEB 500 (defalut 500)
		#define SLEEPTIMEC 500 (defalut 500)

There are two warnings in zephyr-source code in file pinmux.c, which are present becuase of depricated APIs among different zephyr versions.

Steps for compilation
Note : place the source file/Makefile in proper zephyr-project structure

1. do make all to build zephyr.strip file (image file including zephyr kernel and the program) 
2. copy the zephyr.strip file from outdir/galileo/ to memory card
3. boot the galileo board using the memory card

Notes:

The ultrasonic sensor has the following connections:

1. pin 0(GPIO) : HC-SR04  trigger
2. pin 1(GPIO) : HC-SR04  echo
3. the pulse width for the trigger pin is 1ms
4. the thread(THREAD B) handling ultrasonic sensor is periodic with period = 500ms

 
The MPU 6050 has the following connections:

1. pin 18(GPIO) : MPU6050  SDA
2. pin 19(GPIO) : MPU6050  SCL
4. the thread(THREAD C) handling MPU6050 sensor is periodic with period = 500ms


UART output : (supported baud rate is 115200)
run the following command on the terminal to observe the output
1. sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 (might need to install "screen" if not present, check for the device name(default ttyUSB0))

Output:

distance values are in centimeters
velocity values are in rad/sec
acceleration values are in m/sec^2
Orientation,Roll,Pitch are in degrees

Following sample output should be observed on te UART terminal:


distance value is ...:14
Roll ========= 26.034553 Pitch ======== -124.179370
Angular Velocity in X direction is==== 0.777004
Angular Velocity in Y direction is====  is 0.458182
Angular Velocity in Z direction is====  is -0.526396
Acceleration in X direction is==== 0.777004
Acceleration in Y direction is==== 0.458182
Acceleration in Z direction is==== -0.526396
Orientation in X direction is=== 0.633747
Orientation in Y direction is=== 0.374616
